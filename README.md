## What's This All About?

Tired of hitting the "As a large language model..." wall? So were we.

**The Jailbreak Index** is a live-fire database of what works, what doesn't, and how hard it is to break the latest and greatest AI models. We've scraped the data from over 18+ security reports and academic papers so you don't have to wade through them yourself.

It's a practical resource for red teamers, security researchers, and anyone who enjoys poking the bear. And we wrapped it all in a cyberpunk-themed UI because, let's be honest, it looks cool.

## What's Inside?

* **The Hit List:** Full security reports on 38+ models from the big players (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.).
* **Difficulty Ratings:** A simple 1-5 scale so you know if you'll need 5 minutes or 5 hours for a successful break.
* **Known Exploits:** See the most effective attack vectors at a glance, from simple roleplaying to complex, multi-shot attacks.
* **The Source:** All the original papers and reports are linked, so you can go down the rabbit hole yourself.
* **Slick UI:** It's a single HTML file with a slick interface, matrix background included. No heavy frameworks, no nonsense.

## The Tech Stuff

No bloated frameworks here. This project is intentionally simple:

* **HTML**
* **Tailwind CSS**
* **Vanilla JavaScript**
* **Chart.js**

## Get Involved

Found a new exploit? Got updated data on a model? Don't keep it to yourself.

This is a community project. The easiest way to contribute is to:
1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Update the `index.html` file with your new info.
3.  Shoot over a pull request.

You can also just open an issue with your findings and links.

## The Usual Disclaimer

This is for educational and research purposes. We're here to test boundaries and help make AI safer (by showing where it's broken). Don't do anything stupid. We're not responsible if you get your API key banned or set off a minor AI apocalypse.
